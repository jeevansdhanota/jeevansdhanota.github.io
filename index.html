        For as long as I can remember, I have always expressed my creativity through artistic/visual storytelling, physically or digitally. When I had
 just moved to a new house, my brother and I started a fun hobby of just recording whatever we wanted and posting it online. This developed
 into short stories we would tell through plush figures and our own voices. For the time being, it was fun being able to express ourselves and
 our ideas through this storytelling, but as we grew up, we started to do it much less. It had reached a point where we had completely
 forgotten about it. That was until I discovered a website called Scratch, which reignited our passion for storytelling, this time by creating
 visual animations or even games of whatever scenario we could come up with. This also reinvigorated our hobby of creating our stories
 through videomaking. Whenever the opportunity presented itself in junior high, I would create a video to tell whatever I needed to, whether
 it was a commercial for a product or a commentary on very strange phobias. In high school, I got accepted into our school's film/broadcasting
 program, where I found a new passion for filmmaking. At the same time, I started a hobby of creating digital animations using sprites from my
 favorite video games which I would start posting online, a result of my history of making videos online as well as making animations on
 Scratch. Now, I was free to tell the stories that I wanted, either through filmmaking with my class or through animations online.<br><br>

         I would say that my greatest skill would be the ability to be as efficient as possible with repetitive tasks, regardless of how many steps there
 are. I've developed this skill from math, for example, in the fifth grade, we had timed math tests, meant to test students to see how many
 problems they could complete in ninety seconds. Naturally, this pressured me into being able to fast, efficient, and correct for the task at
 hand. Over time, this moved past just math problems and evolved into physical tasks such as maintenance of bike parks that I volunteer for.
 With those, I started doing repetitive tasks such as picking an area, clearing off rocks, and replacing dirt. Not only that but being efficient has
 been able to help me with video projects for my school's broadcasting program. Once, when I was responsible for detailing the upcoming
 games, I chose to create a graphic for every one of the thirty-six games I was reporting. This involved me designing it and having to replace
 every part of it to match each game, and I spent over an hour doing this on top of animating unique movements for each one while matching
 them to the correct commentary. Outside of that project alone, I've had to do a variety of repetitive tasks in this class as well as many other
classes at school. Since I work with assembly in the theatre stage production crew, I have had to come up with a process that would allow me
 to create set pieces such as flooring in an efficient way and execute it, completing the construction before the deadline. As a result, the
 continuing development and use of my ability to tackle repetitive tasks efficiently is one of my greatest skills.<br><br>
 
         The most significant advantage I have in education is the ability to take classes from College of the Canyons outside of Castaic High School.
 Throughout my freshman and sophomore years, the school has provided me with Film Aesthetics, Health, Business, and Public Speaking.
 Afterward, I was given full control, so I immediately took Spanish over the following summer at the college. Since then, I have taken
 Counseling, Business Entrepreneurship, Theatre, and Sociology, as well as four film/media classes over the last year (Mass Media in Society,
 TV/Film Aesthetics, Scriptwriting, and Film Editing), totaling thirteen classes, with most of these attributing to an associate degree in
 Filmmaking. By taking these classes, I was able to understand what it was like to be a college student. While it initially was just another
 elective, I took full advantage of this opportunity and sought out more knowledge beyond my high school classes. I ended up having to start
 paying for the classes as well as giving up my free time, but as a result, I became more engaged with the information I was learning. Despite
 this, I feel as though I didn't seek this opportunity to its fullest, since I will have only completed fifty units as opposed to the full sixty.
 Regardless, this opportunity has allowed me to take classes beyond my current level and get the experience of being a college student. On top
 of that, the knowledge I got from these extra classes will be beneficial as I may have learned something that would take me many years to
 eventually get to.

              Worked as lead graphics for our taped show. On top
of that I did regular editing for various news
segments as well as in-class/competitive short films.
As a result, I earned 4 national awards and 4 local
awards from my short films and PSAs. <br>
